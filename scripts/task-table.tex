The \taco{}'s relationship with Amar \etals \cite{amar2005low} task list. We test these tasks  with a set of $\alpha$s that sometimes create \colorbox{red!25}{confusers under some conditions} as well as those that \colorbox{red!50}{always create confusers}.

Find Extremum & Change Extremum \\
Sort & Cell wise inverse ($x \rightarrow x^{-1}$) \\
Determine Range & Scale all points by a single scalar \cellcolor{red!25}\\
