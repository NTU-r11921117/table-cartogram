An extended version of \tabref{tab:nusrat-table}, which related Amar \etals \cite{amar2005low} low level task taxonomy to a set of AVD $\alpha$s meant to probe the pliability of the table cartogram to that task.

\toprule
Task & Task Description & Example Task & AVD $\alpha$  & Confuser \\
\toprule
Retrieve Value & Find a particular value. Approximately equal to the \emph{Lookup} task \cite{brehmer2013multi}. & How many crossings were there are the 15th of july? What was the weather on September 27  & Change value & Yes, if label is not numerical \\
Filter & Find cells which that are larger than a particular cell & Which days are bigger than average?  &  &  \\
Compute Derived Val & Extract aggregate & What fraction of bike crossings does summer account for?   & Double the size of the group in question & No \\
Find Extremum & Find the largest or smallest cell & Find the day with largest number of crossings? Find the day with the least?  & Change Extremum & No \\
Sort & Extension of find extremum & Which day had the second most? The third? etc  & Cell wise inverse ($x \rightarrow x^{-1}$) & No \\
Determine Range & Find sizes of min and max & What is the minimum number of bike crossings  & Scale all points by a single scalar & Yes \\
Characterize Distrib & Describe the distribution,identify normalacy & What parts of the week do people typically ride? What parts of the month? What parts of the year?  & Change Distribution & Yes, if change in distrubution happens not in period with present binning \\
Find Anomalies & Identify items that are unusual & Do any particular days have especially low counts? High counts?  & Induce or remove an outlier  & Yes, if rendering is noisey \\
Cluster & Identify cells of a similar size & What days have a similar rideship as March 3rd  & Make all cells be similar or dissimilar  & No \\
Correlate & Relate one variable to another & Do mondays in Janurary tend to have more biking than Wednesdays in November? Do people tend to ride in the rain?  & Remove correlation of correlated data & No \\
