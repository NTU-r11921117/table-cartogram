Task Origin	Task	USING	Explanation	Example cartogram task	Alpha	Confuser	Confuser Summary	Validation: A different graphic where this alpha might fail
Amar	Retrieve Value	Yes	Find a particular value. Approximately equal to the \emph{Lookup} task \cite{brehmer2013multi}.	How many crossings were there are the 15th of july? What was the weather on September 27	Change value	Yes, if label is not numerical	Sometimes	Aggregate Bar chart
	Filter	Yes	Find cells which that are larger than a particular cell	Which days are bigger than average?				
	Compute Derived Val	Yes	Extract aggregate	What fraction of bike crossings does summer account for? 	Double the size of the group in question	No	No	
	Find Extremum	Yes	Find the largest or smallest cell	Find the day with largest number of crossings? Find the day with the least?	Change Extremum	No	No	Aggregate Bar chart
	Sort	Yes	Extension of find extremum	Which day had the second most? The third? etc	Cell wise inverse ($x \rightarrow x^{-1}$)	No	No	Aggregate Bar chart
	Determine Range	Yes	Find sizes of min and max	What is the minimum number of bike crossings	Scale all points by a single scalar	Yes	Yes	
	Characterize Distrib	Yes	Describe the distribution,identify normalacy	What parts of the week do people typically ride? What parts of the month? What parts of the year?	Change Distribution	Yes, if change in distrubution happens not in period with present binning	Sometimes	
	Find Anomalies	Yes	Identify items that are unusual	Do any particular days have especially low counts? High counts?	Induce or remove an outlier 	Yes, if rendering is noisey	Sometimes	Aggregate Bar chart
	Cluster	Yes	Identify cells of a similar size	What days have a similar rideship as March 3rd	Make all cells be similar or dissimilar 	No	No	
	Correlate	Yes	Relate one variable to another	Do mondays in Janurary tend to have more biking than Wednesdays in November? Do people tend to ride in the rain?	Remove correlation of correlated data	No	No

	Summarize	N/A	Give an overall characterization of the visualization. Also analyze or compare distributions	What season do people tend to ride their bikes in most? What part of the week?	Reverse distribution	No	No
