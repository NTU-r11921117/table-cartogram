# Table Cartograms

Table cartograms are a novel way to represent tabular information. Tabular information comes in all shapes and sizes and so do the associated table cartograms.

In this library we provide an iteration based approach to creating table cartograms. We follow a very simple optimization approach in which we select from a library of initializations, also allowing for custom ones, and then iteratively adjust the vertices via gradient descent until a satisfactory condition is reached.

TODO

### Local Development

1. Have Yarn/Node/Npm Installed
2. Install our deps
```sh
yarn
```
3. Start up the development sandbox
```sh
yarn start
```

After you've developed things, make sure that code passes the tests:

```sh
yarn lint
yarn test
```

And then you're good!
